# SPPU SE Data Structures and Algorithms Practicals

This repository contains implementation of various Data Structures and Algorithms concepts as part of the Second Year Computer Engineering curriculum at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU).

## Practical Programs

1. **prac1.py** - Telephone book database using hash table with collision handling techniques
2. **prac2.py** - Set ADT implementation with add, remove and contains operations
3. **prac3.cpp** - Tree structure for book chapters and sections
4. **prac4.cpp** - Expression tree from prefix expression with post-order traversal
5. **prac5.cpp** - Binary Search Tree operations
6. **prac6.cpp** - Graph representation using adjacency matrix/list with DFS/BFS
7. **prac7.cpp** - Minimum spanning tree for office phone line connections
8. **prac8.cpp** - Optimal Binary Search Tree with search probabilities
9. **prac9.cpp** - Dictionary implementation with CRUD operations
10. **prac10.cpp** - Hospital patient priority queue system
11. **prac11.cpp** - Employee information management system
12. **prac12.cpp** - Student information management system

## Usage

1. For Python programs:
```bash
